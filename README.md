# qMGST
This is an annealing-based quantum algorithm for the Minimum Group Steiner Tree Problem. 
The main.cpp is code for generating the QUBO matrix. 
The example graph and the corresponding QUBO matrix is given by graph.txt and qubo.txt, respectively. 
The qMGST.py is code for D-wave service, where you need to generate your own API token.
